# Conclusion{#sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, our illustration suggests that the proposed geometric conceptualization, which distinguishes *distributional* and *structural* outlier on a general level, provides a more precise terminology and shows that outlier detection in high-dimensional and complex non-tabular data does need to be specifically challenging per se. Convincing results could be achieved in a wide range of settings and data types by a combination of the simple methods MDS for dimension reduction and visualization and LOF for outlier scoring. We hope that the proposed framework contributes to a better understanding of unsupervised outlier detection and provides some guidance to practitioners as well as methodological researchers in this regard.
